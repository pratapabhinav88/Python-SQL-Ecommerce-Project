# Python-SQL-Ecommerce-Project
The project aims to demonstrate the integration of Python and SQL to manage, analyze, and query eCommerce data effectively. This involves converting raw dataset formats into a structured SQL database and performing data analysis or other operations using SQL queries through Python.

# Project Workflow

# Dataset Acquisition
#### Began by selecting a dataset representing eCommerce data. This dataset could include information such as product details, customer data, transactions, and order history.

# Data Preprocessing
### The dataset was preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency. This step might involve:
#### Handling missing values.
#### Formatting data into a suitable structure for SQL storage.
#### Renaming columns or restructuring the dataset for better usability.

# Conversion from CSV to SQL
### The dataset, originally in CSV format, was imported into Python using libraries like pandas.
### Python was used to convert the CSV into SQL using libraries like:
#### SQLite for creating local databases.

# SQL Database Creation
#### Tables were created within the SQL database to store structured data.
#### Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints were added to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
### Example tables include:
#### Products: Stores details like product ID, name, category, price, etc.
#### Customers: Includes customer IDs, names, email, and other demographic data.
#### Orders: Links customer and product data, showing order details, timestamps, and quantities.

# Data Insertion
### The CSV data was inserted into the respective SQL tables using Python's database connectors such as:
#### sqlite3 for SQLite databases.
#### mysql.connector for MySQL or other databases.

# Data Analysis and Operations
### SQL queries were executed from Python to analyze the eCommerce data. Examples of operations:
#### Retrieving top-selling products.
#### Identifying high-value customers based on transaction history.
#### Analyzing order trends over time.
### These queries were written in SQL and executed through Python, leveraging libraries like sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy.

# Visualization
## Insights obtained from the SQL queries were visualized using Python libraries such as:
#### Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting graphs.
#### Plotly for interactive visualizations.
## For instance:
#### A bar chart showing revenue per category.
#### A line chart displaying monthly sales trends.

# Reporting and Documentation
### The project was documented to showcase the steps involved and insights obtained.
### The documentation includes code snippets, SQL query examples, and visualization outputs.

# Key Features
#### Integration: Seamless integration between Python and SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
#### Automation: Automated conversion of raw CSV data into a structured SQL database.
#### Scalability: A well-designed SQL schema to handle future data expansions.
#### Usability: Easy-to-use Python scripts for querying and visualizing data.
